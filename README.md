This program will add or subtract two roman numerals as character arrays and then output the new roman numeral character array solution.

The Addition and Subtraction functions assume that the output will not go over 3999 (But it is capable of it). Empty string ("") will be output if you try. the maximum value can me modified in code, search for maxValue variable in Kata.c 

The Subtraction function assumes the first input(val1) is greater than the second input(val2) so that the output is greater than or equal to 1("I"). If the user attempts to make the second value larger then an empty string ("") will be output.

To compile please run the following command in the root directory: 
make

Programmed and Compiled using GCC on Ubuntu 14.04
