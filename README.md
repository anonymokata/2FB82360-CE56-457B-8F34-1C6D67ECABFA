This program will add or subtract two roman numerals as character arrays and then output the new roman numeral character array.

The Addition and Subtraction functions assume that the output will not go over 3999 (But it is capable of it).

The Subtraction function assumes the first input(val1) is greater than the second input(val2) so that the output is greater than or equal to 1("I").

To compile please run the following command in the root directory:
